# Multimodal AI Assistant

> A fully-featured AI companion that sees, speaks, and creates—all running locally on your machine.

## What is This?

Ever wanted an AI assistant that truly understands you? One that you can **talk to naturally**, **show images**, and have it **generate visuals** in response? This multimodal AI assistant brings together the best of modern AI capabilities into one seamless experience.

**Note**: This project is being vibe coded—built organically and iteratively as ideas flow.

## Key Features

### **Natural Conversations**
- Speak naturally using your microphone—no typing required
- Multiple input modes: voice, text, or text + images
- Real-time voice responses with customizable TTS engines

### **Visual Understanding**
- Show it an image and describe what you want
- Powered by local vision-language models for privacy
- Understands context from both your words and images

### **Image Generation**
- Creates images based on conversation context
- The AI can autonomously decide when to generate visuals
- Uses local Stable Diffusion for complete privacy

### **Privacy-First**
- Everything runs locally—no cloud dependencies required (optional)
- Your conversations and images never leave your machine
- Optional cloud LLM support for those who don't have powerful hardware

## How It Works

1. **Input** → Talk, type, or share images with the assistant
2. **Understanding** → Vision models describe images, speech is transcribed
3. **Thinking** → Your chosen LLM processes everything as natural conversation
4. **Response** → Get spoken responses and generated images in real-time

## Tech Stack

- **Speech-to-Text**: Faster Whisper (local transcription)
- **Vision Understanding**: Qwen3VL-2B/4B (local vision-language model)
- **Language Model**: Ollama (supports local and cloud deployment)
- **Image Generation**: Stable Diffusion / Qwen Image Edit
- **Text-to-Speech**: Multiple engines (Piper, Chatterbox, Soprano)
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Vite
- **Backend**: FastAPI + WebSockets

## System Requirements

### Recommended Requirements
- **RAM**: 16GB or more
- **GPU**: NVIDIA GPU with 12GB+ VRAM
- **Storage**: 50GB+ free space

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multimodal-ai-assistant.git
cd multimodal-ai-assistant
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Python dependencies
pip install -e .

# Frontend is automatically built during pip install
# If you need to rebuild manually:
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the example environment file and configure it:

```bash
# Windows
copy src\aiassistant\.env.example src\aiassistant\.env

# Linux/Mac
cp src/aiassistant/.env.example src/aiassistant/.env
```

Edit `src/aiassistant/.env` with your preferred settings. See [Configuration Guide](#configuration-guide) below for details.

### 4. Download Required Models

See [Model Setup](#model-setup) section for detailed instructions on downloading and configuring models.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Start the backend server
python -m aiassistant.app

# The application will be available at http://localhost:8000
```

## Configuration Guide

All configuration is done through environment variables in the `.env` file. Here are the key settings:

### Low VRAM Mode

```bash
LOW_VRAM_MODE=true  # Unloads models after use to save memory
```

### LLM Configuration

**Option 1: Local Ollama (Recommended)**
```bash
LLM_HOST=http://localhost:11434
LLM_MODEL=llama3.2  # or mistral, qwen2.5, etc.
LLM_DEVICE=auto     # auto, cuda, or cpu
```

1. Install Ollama from https://ollama.com/download
2. Pull a model: `ollama pull llama3.2`
3. Start Ollama service

**Option 2: Ollama Cloud**
```bash
LLM_HOST=https://ollama.com
LLM_MODEL=glm-4.7:cloud
```

Get an API key from https://ollama.com

**Option 3: Custom Implementation**

You can implement your own LLM provider by extending the base class in `src/aiassistant/llm/base.py`.

### Speech-to-Text (Whisper)

```bash
WHISPER_MODEL=distil-medium.en  # or tiny.en, base.en, small.en, medium.en, large-v3
WHISPER_DEVICE=cuda             # cuda or cpu
WHISPER_COMPUTE=float16         # float16, float32, or int8
```

Models are automatically downloaded from HuggingFace on first run.

### Text-to-Speech

**Option 1: Piper TTS (Default - Fast & Lightweight)**
```bash
TTS_ENGINE=piper
PIPER_USE_CUDA=true
```

Download voices from: https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/tree/main

Place `.onnx` and `.json` files in: `src/models/voices/pipertts/`

**Option 2: Chatterbox TTS (Expressive)**
```bash
TTS_ENGINE=chatterbox
CHATTERBOX_DEVICE=cuda
```

Requires: `pip install chatterbox-tts`

**Option 3: Soprano TTS (Fast & Lightweight)**
```bash
TTS_ENGINE=soprano
SOPRANO_DEVICE=cuda
```

Requires: `pip install soprano-tts`

### Image Generation

```bash
IMAGEGEN_ENABLED=true
IMAGEGEN_MODEL=prompthero/openjourney  # HuggingFace model ID or local path
IMAGEGEN_DEVICE=cuda
IMAGEGEN_WIDTH=512    # Lower for less VRAM (512x512 = ~6GB VRAM)
IMAGEGEN_HEIGHT=512
IMAGEGEN_STEPS=30     # 20-30 for speed, 40-50 for quality
```

Popular models:
- `prompthero/openjourney` - Fast, small VRAM
- `runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5` - General purpose
- `stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-1` - Better quality

Models are downloaded from HuggingFace on first run, or you can point to a local directory.

**ComfyUI Integration (Coming Soon)**

You can implement ComfyUI endpoints by extending `src/aiassistant/imagegen/base.py`.

### Image Explainer (Vision-Language Model)

```bash
IMAGEEXPLAINER_ENABLED=true
IMAGEEXPLAINER_MODEL=huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-abliterated
IMAGEEXPLAINER_DEVICE=auto
```

Models:
- `huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-2B-Instruct-abliterated` - 2B params, lower VRAM
- `huihui-ai/Huihui-Qwen3-VL-4B-Instruct-abliterated` - 4B params, better quality

Models are downloaded from HuggingFace on first run.

- Anyone who wants a truly interactive AI companion

## Future Plans

### Live 2D/3D Character with Emotions

The ultimate vision is to have an animated 3D model of your choice that reacts and interacts during conversations, something similar to VTuber. Using technologies like Qwen ControlNet, image editing pipelines, PyGame, Wan, and all other opensource video/image generation models it should be possible to create a fully animated avatar that:
- Lip-syncs to generated speech
- Shows expressions and reactions based on conversation context
- Responds with gestures and body language (essentially a more advanced version of microsoft CLIPPY, yes I am OLD)

Features would include:
- Lip-sync to generated speech
- Facial expressions based on conversation context
- Gestures and body language
- Real-time emotion detection and response

This is a long-term pipe dream, but with current AI models advancing rapidly, it should become feasible soon. Think of it as a more advanced, AI-powered Microsoft Clippy! 📎

### Other Planned Features

- Multi-character support (character profiles)
- Conversation memory and context management
- Voice cloning for personalized TTS
- Custom image generation styles and LoRA support
- Export/import conversation history
- Plugin system for custom engines
